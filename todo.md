# TO DO

_Definition of Done is to do all these ... _
* ~~Refactor specs to not repeat themselves~~
* ~~Work out how to replace before(:each) with before(:all)~~ you can't
* ~~Rename greetings array~~
* Fill in readme and gemspec and description
* Move array elsewhere in class
* ~~Test for osx and handle appropriately if not~~
	
use RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os'] instead of RUBY_PLATFORM
* It's not testing in the context of the command line - can you test the CLI?
* ~~Still not testing the say command?? Or rather a system command~~
* Why does say not actually execute when testing system??
* Do something better with handling names and cleaning up the formatting

-> _Then you can publish it!_
