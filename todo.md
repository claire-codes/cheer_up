# TO DO

_Definition of Done is to do all these ... _
* Refactor specs to not repeat themselves
* Work out how to replace before(:each) with before(:all)
* Add name interpolation to greetings in order to clean up code
* Rename greetings array? And classes? Make more sarcastically semantic
* Fill in readme and gemspec
* Test for osx and handle appropriately if not
use RbConfig::CONFIG['host_os'] instead of RUBY_PLATFORM
* Work out if you're testing the CLI or just the class - can you test the CLI?
* Still not testing the say command?? Or rather a system command

-> _Then you can publish it!_
