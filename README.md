## Note

Alas I was in the process of releasing this as a Gem before I realised that a the cheer_up gem already existed ... you can now find the proper one as `cheerup` and this will stay here for posterity. R.I.P. repo.

# CheerUp

My First [Very Daft] Ruby Gem

Having a bad day? Need cheering up? Get your Mac to say something cheery to you with this Gem - although Mac isn't having a great day either.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cheer_up'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cheer_up

## Usage

From the command line:
    
    $ cheer up

Also accepts an optional name arg if you want to be more personal.

    $ cheer up Antony


## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/[USERNAME]/cheer_up, although I probably don't know how to fix it.

_Wittier ways to cheer someone up are particularly welcome._
